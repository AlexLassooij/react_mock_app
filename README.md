This is a static mock website created with React by myself and three teammates. It does not have any specific purpose, instead we created this website to practice our skills with React, JS, HTML and CSS before tackling on real tasks within our team.

My teammates and I are part of Building Blocks UBC, an initiative that strives to improve student health. Its goal is to form communities consisting of senior and new incoming students by the means of an app. As a result, students will have access to communities that offer them resources, information and the support they may need.
